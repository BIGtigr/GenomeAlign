Here is a Lastz-ChainNet-Ortholog pipeline for whole genome synteny alignment.
If you want to understand the whole pipeline ,please read :
http://genomewiki.ucsc.edu/index.php/Whole_genome_alignment_howto

1. whole genome alignment by LASTZ (the genome is better to mask the repeats into  lower case) 
A tool for aligning two DNA sequences, and inferring appropriate scoring parameters automatically.  

LASTZ is a drop-in replacement for BLASTZ, and is backward compatible with BLASTZ's command-line syntax. That is, it supports all of BLASTZ's options but also has additional ones, and may produce slightly different alignment results.

2. chain the alignment with same sequence within long gaps and choose the best pairwise alignment for each Target sequence region by ChainNet Package 

more information: all ChainNet format
http://genome.ucsc.edu/FAQ/FAQformat


3. choose the best pairwise alignment for Both Target and Query sequence region by ortholog_net
This scrpit is valid in Animal comparation which is considered as no whole genome duplication for Myrs
While in Plant it do has one-multi or multi-multi alignment for their continuously whole genome duplications , and hard to confirm which is really the best result

Example

mkdir output 
chdir output
perl ../bin/step0_data_preparation.pl  -spec arab -i ../input/arab.fa -cut 0 (using qsub)
perl ../bin/step0_data_preparation.pl  -spec cucumber -i ../input/cucumber.fa -cut 0 (using qsub)
perl ../bin/step1_run_lastz.pl -tar_spec arab -qry_spec cucumber (using qsub)
wait for above two script down ...
perl ../bin/step2_chainnet.pl  -tar_spec arab -qry_spec cucumber -tar_latin ARATH -qry_latin CUSCA(using qsub)
wait for above script down ...
perl ../bin/step3_ortholog_net.pl (Just an example, do not do it in a plant comparation)
